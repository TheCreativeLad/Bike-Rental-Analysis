Dataset Information
-------

Bike sharing systems are new generation of traditional bike rentals where whole process from membership, rental and return back has become automatic. Through these systems, user is able to easily rent a bike from a particular position and return back at another position. Currently, there are about over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world which is composed of over 500 thousands bicycles. Today, there exists great interest in these systems due to their important role in traffic, environmental and health issues.

Apart from interesting real world applications of bike sharing systems, the characteristics of data being generated by these systems make them attractive for the research. Opposed to other transport services such as bus or subway, the duration of travel, departure and arrival position is explicitly recorded in these systems. This feature turns bike sharing system into a virtual sensor network that can be used for sensing mobility in the city. Hence, it is expected that most of important events in the city could be detected via monitoring these data.

Dataset characteristics:
-------

Both hour.csv and day.csv have the following fields, except hr which is not available in day.csv

instant: record index

datetime: The timestamp of the bike rental record, including both date and time. This column is essential for analyzing temporal patterns in bike rentals.

season: The season in which the bike rental occurred. Usually encoded as:
Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall

hr : hour (0 to 23)

yr : year (0: 2011, 1:2012)

holiday: A binary indicator (0 or 1) showing whether the day is a public holiday. This column helps in understanding the impact of holidays on bike rental demand.

workingday: A binary indicator (0 or 1) indicating whether the day is a working day (i.e., neither a weekend nor a holiday). This column is useful for distinguishing between weekday and weekend rental patterns.

weekday : day of the week

weathersit : A categorical variable describing the weather conditions during the bike rental period. Commonly encoded as:
1. Clear, Few clouds, Partly cloudy, Partly cloudy
2. Mist + Cloudy, Mist + Broken clouds, Mist + Few clouds, Mist
3. Light Snow, Light Rain + Thunderstorm + Scattered clouds, Light Rain + Scattered clouds
4. Heavy Rain + Ice Pallets + Thunderstorm + Mist, Snow + Fog

temp: The temperature (in Celsius) at the time of the bike rental. This continuous variable helps in analyzing how 
temperature influences bike rental activity.

atemp: The "feels-like" temperature (in Celsius) at the time of the bike rental. This adjusted temperature takes into account factors like humidity and wind chill.

humidity: Normalized humidity. The values are divided to 100 (max).

windspeed: Normalized wind speed. The values are divided to 67 (max).

casual: The number of casual users (non-registered) who rented bikes. This count provides insights into how occasional users contribute to overall bike rentals.

registered: The number of registered users who rented bikes. This count reflects the activity of regular users who have a membership or subscription to the bike-sharing system.

cnt: The total number of bikes rented, summing both casual and registered users. This column is the primary target variable for analyzing and predicting bike rental demand.
